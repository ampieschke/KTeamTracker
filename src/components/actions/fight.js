              Roll attack dice equal to the selected weapon attack
              characteristic. Dice that equal or beat the weapons Skill
              Characteristic are successful hits. Each that doesnâ€™t is failed
              and discarded. A 6 is always a successful hit, and a 1 is always a
              failed hit. Keep track of each result of a 6 - this is a critical
              hit.

              Resolve successful hits - Starting with the attacker, each player
              alternates resolving one of their successful hits to Strike or
              Parry. They repeat this process until one operative in that combat
              is incapacitated or they have no more hits to resolve, in which
              case their opponent resolves all of their remaining hits.
